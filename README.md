# Mobile-Sales-Trends-Analysis

Welcome to the Mobile Sales & Trends Analysis Challenge!

Pretend you are a data analyst for a major mobile phone retailer operating across multiple countries. You’ve been given a 2024 sales dataset, containing detailed records of mobile phone transactions, customer demographics, product specifications, and geographic locations.


The dataset combines information about the models sold, their prices, storage sizes, colors, operating systems, and customer demographics like age group and gender. It also captures where and how the sales were made – online, through partners, or in-store, and the type of payment used.

Your goal is to build a report that tells the story of mobile sales across different regions, highlights best-selling products and trends, and helps the business understand customer behavior better.


Key questions to answer in your analysis:
1. Which mobile brands and models are the top sellers overall and in specific countries or cities?
2. How do sales numbers vary by storage size, color, or operating system (Android vs. iOS)?
3. What is the typical customer profile — age group, gender — for different brands or models?
4. How do sales and revenues break down across different sales channels (online, partner, in-store) and payment types?
5. Are there noticeable differences in pricing and sales volume between regions or cities?
6. Which countries or cities generate the highest total revenue and units sold?
7. Are there patterns in customer demographics based on mobile brand, model, or price range?
8. How does sales performance change month over month in 2024?
9. Are there correlations between customer age groups and the type of devices they purchase (for example, younger customers preferring certain brands)?
10. The questions above are provided to guide your exploration but are not mandatory. Feel free to shape your analysis based on the story you want to tell.
